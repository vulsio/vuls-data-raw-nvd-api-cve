			"value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix a crash when we run out of stations\n\nA DoS tool that injects loads of authentication frames made our AP\ncrash. The iwl_mvm_is_dup() function couldn't find the per-queue\ndup_data which was not allocated.\n\nThe root cause for that is that we ran out of stations in the firmware\nand we didn't really add the station to the firmware, yet we didn't\nreturn an error to mac80211.\nMac80211 was thinking that we have the station and because of that,\nsta_info::uploaded was set to 1. This allowed\nieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() to return a valid station object, but\nthat ieee80211_sta didn't have any iwl_mvm_sta object initialized and\nthat caused the crash mentioned earlier when we got Rx on that station."
