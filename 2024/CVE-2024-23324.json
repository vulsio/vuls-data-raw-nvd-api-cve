Downstream clients can force invalid gRPC requests to be sent to ext_authz, circumventing ext_authz checks when failure_mode_allow is set to true. This issue has been addressed in released 1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, and 1.26.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"
