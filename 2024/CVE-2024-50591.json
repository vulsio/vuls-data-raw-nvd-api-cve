			"value": "An attacker with local access the to medical office computer can \nescalate his Windows user privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by \nexploiting a command injection vulnerability in the Elefant Update \nService. The command injection can be exploited by communicating with \nthe Elefant Update Service which is running as \"SYSTEM\" via Windows \nNamed Pipes.The Elefant Software Updater (ESU) consists of two components. An ESU\n service which runs as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" and an ESU tray client \nwhich communicates with the service to update or repair the installation\n and is running with user permissions. The communication is implemented \nusing named pipes. A crafted message of type \n\"MessageType.SupportServiceInfos\" can be sent to the local ESU service \nto inject commands, which are then executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\"."
