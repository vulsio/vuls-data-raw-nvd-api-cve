			"value": "Ubee DDW365 XCNDDW365 and DDW366 XCNDXW3WB devices have predictable default WPA2 PSKs that could lead to unauthorized remote access. A remote attacker (in proximity to a Wi-Fi network) can derive the default WPA2-PSK value by observing a beacon frame. A PSK is generated by using the first six characters of the SSID and the last six of the BSSID, decrementing the last digit."
