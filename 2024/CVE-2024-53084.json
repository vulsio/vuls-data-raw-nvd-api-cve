			"value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/imagination: Break an object reference loop\n\nWhen remaining resources are being cleaned up on driver close,\noutstanding VM mappings may result in resources being leaked, due\nto an object reference loop, as shown below, with each object (or\nset of objects) referencing the object below it:\n\n    PVR GEM Object\n    GPU scheduler \"finished\" fence\n    GPU scheduler “scheduled” fence\n    PVR driver “done” fence\n    PVR Context\n    PVR VM Context\n    PVR VM Mappings\n    PVR GEM Object\n\nThe reference that the PVR VM Context has on the VM mappings is a\nsoft one, in the sense that the freeing of outstanding VM mappings\nis done as part of VM context destruction; no reference counts are\ninvolved, as is the case for all the other references in the loop.\n\nTo break the reference loop during cleanup, free the outstanding\nVM mappings before destroying the PVR Context associated with the\nVM context."
