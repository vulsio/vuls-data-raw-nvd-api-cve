			"value": "Attackers with local access to the medical office computer can \nescalate their Windows user privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by \noverwriting one of two Elefant service binaries with weak permissions. The default installation directory of Elefant is \"C:\\Elefant1\" which is \nwritable for all users. In addition, the Elefant installer registers two\n Firebird database services which are running as “NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM”. \n\nPath: C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbserver.exe\n\nPath: C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbguard.exe\n\n\nBoth service binaries are user writable. This means that a local \nattacker can rename one of the service binaries, replace the service \nexecutable with a new executable, and then restart the system. Once the \nsystem has rebooted, the new service binary is executed as \"NT \nAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\"."
