			"value": "Katran could disclose non-initialized kernel memory as part of an IP header. The issue was present for IPv4 encapsulation and ICMP (v4) Too Big packet generation. After a bpf_xdp_adjust_head call, Katran code didnâ€™t initialize the Identification field for the IPv4 header, resulting in writing content of kernel memory in that field of IP header. The issue affected all Katran versions prior to commit 6a03106ac1eab39d0303662963589ecb2374c97f"
