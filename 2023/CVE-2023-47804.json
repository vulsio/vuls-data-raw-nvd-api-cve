Several URI Schemes are defined for this purpose.\n\nLinks can be activated by clicks, or by automatic document events.\n\nThe execution of such links must be subject to user approval.\n\nIn the affected versions of OpenOffice, approval for certain links is not requested; when activated, such links could therefore result in arbitrary script execution.\n\nThis is a corner case of CVE-2022-47502.\n\n"
