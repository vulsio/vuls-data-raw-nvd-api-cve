			"value": "In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn the \"Project\" module, the maven build args  “<” operator causes command injection. e.g : “< (curl  http://xxx.com )” will be executed as a command injection,\n\nMitigation:\n\nall users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  The \"<\" operator will blocked。\n\n"
