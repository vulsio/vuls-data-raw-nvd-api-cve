			"value": "Knative Serving builds on Kubernetes to support deploying and serving of applications and functions as serverless containers. An attacker who controls a pod to a degree where they can control the responses from the /metrics endpoint can cause Denial-of-Service of the autoscaler from an unbound memory allocation bug. This is a DoS vulnerability, where a non-privileged Knative user can cause a DoS for the cluster. This issue has been patched in version 0.39.0."
