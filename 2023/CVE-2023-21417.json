			"value": "Sandro Poppi, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program,\n\nhas found that the VAPIX API manageoverlayimage.cgi was vulnerable to path traversal attacks that allows for file/folder deletion. This flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an operator- or administrator- privileged service account. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is lower with operator service accounts and limited to non-system files compared to administrator-privileges.\n Axis has released patched AXIS OS versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information and solution. \n\n\n\n"
